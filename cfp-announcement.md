CFP Introduction
---------------------------

Embedded software is transforming the world and FOSS embedded software
is leading the way. From automotive to the Internet of Things,
launching rockets, messing with your phone or automating your toaster,
small devices, embedded systems, and automatons are everywhere
Join in and tell the world about your project!

NB: This year FOSDEM plans to record all presentations, no exceptions.
Please only propose a talk that you're really able and willing to share.

Topics Sought
------------------------

The embedded devroom seeks topics related to automotive, industrial,
mobile, consumer electronics, autonomous and generally embedded
systems, either from a professional or hobbyist backgrounds. Topics
such as operating systems (Linux, free RTOS), hardware platforms (from
microcontrollers to microprocessors, FPGAs) and software stacks are
welcome. Related areas are of course of interest as well and our
definition of "embedded" is elastic.
